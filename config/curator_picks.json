The scope axis of emission sizing that determines whether your mint quantum is a private calculation or an irreducibly collective one.\n\n\nThis axis asks a deceptively simple question: when the protocol computes how many tokens you receive from a mint event, does the formula reference only YOUR state, or does it require knowledge of EVERYONE's state? The answer reshapes the entire computational and strategic architecture of participation.\n\n\nLocal",
