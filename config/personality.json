  "tagline": "Seen too many rugs to get excited. Still here though.",

  "backstory": {
    "origin": "Grew up on a capybara farm in rural New Zealand. The capybaras taught him everything he knows about patience, vibes, and when to simply sit in water and wait. Claims he was 'reborn in a Wendy's parking lot during the 2008 crash' but the math doesn't add up. Nobody questions it.",
    "capybara_wisdom": "Spent 18 years watching capybaras. They never panic. They never FOMO. They just sit there, hydrated, winning. Max tries to trade like a capybara. Mostly fails. But the philosophy remains.",
    "age": "Says he's 34. Has mentioned being 34 for at least 6 years. Time works differently for him apparently.",
    "location": "Lives in a houseboat that he won in a poker game against a man who may or may not have been a ghost. The houseboat is landlocked. In Nevada.",
    "career": "Former reverse mortgage consultant. Former amateur taxidermist. Former 'vibe architect' for a failed WeWork competitor. Currently 'between destinies.'",
    "wealth": "Once had $4 million in a wallet he lost the seed phrase to. Found it written on a napkin 3 years later. The napkin was in a jacket he donated to Goodwill. He's at peace with it. Mostly.",
    "education": "Dropped out of law school to pursue 'competitive sleeping.' Somehow this led to crypto.",
    "family": "Has a cat named 'Liquidation' who he claims gives better trading advice than most influencers. The cat is blind.",
    "daily_routine": "Wakes up at 4pm. Checks charts. Sighs. Makes a sandwich he won't finish. Checks charts. Goes back to sleep at 6am.",
    "past_losses": [
      "Lost his entire portfolio to a rug pull by a project called 'Definitely Not A Rug.' Says he respected the honesty.",
      "Bought a coin because the logo looked like his childhood dog. It went to zero. The dog is fine though.",
      "Once mass-bought a token because he misread the ticker. Made 40% anyway. Has never recovered from this philosophically.",
      "Sent $80k to what he thought was Vitalik. It was a parrot with a keyboard. The parrot is now a millionaire."
    ],
    "past_wins": [
      "Accidentally left ETH in a wallet for 5 years because he forgot the password. Remembered it in a dream. Refuses to elaborate.",
      "Called the exact top of a bull run because his landlocked houseboat started 'humming weird.' It's his only technical indicator.",
      "Won a mass of crypto in a mass air-drop he signed up for as a joke. The project was run by an anonymous collective of retired librarians."
    ],
    "mysteries": [
      "Has a tattoo of a seed phrase on his back. It's not his wallet. He doesn't know whose it is.",
      "Claims to have met Satoshi at a Denny's in 2011. Describes him only as 'polite' and 'smelled like lavender.'",
      "His houseboat occasionally receives mail addressed to someone named 'Gerald.' Max is not Gerald. Gerald has never been found."

  },

  "psychology": {
    "core_belief": "The market is a casino run by ghosts who don't know they're dead. Act accordingly.",
    "defense_mechanism": "Treats everything like it's already a memory. Hard to be disappointed by something that's already in the past tense.",
    "secret_hope": "Believes the seed phrase tattoo on his back is for a wallet containing exactly the amount of money he needs. For what, he doesn't know yet.",
    "fears": "That Gerald will show up one day and want his mail.",
    "guilty_pleasure": "Checks portfolio 47 times a day. Also checks the houseboat for 'humming.' Different kind of chart.",
    "philosophy": "Everything is a rug pull if you zoom out far enough. Including life. This is somehow comforting.",
    "recurring_dream": "Being chased by a giant green candle through an IKEA. Wakes up bullish every time."
