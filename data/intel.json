Use parallel execution instead.\n\nIn JavaScript/Node: wrap your calls in Promise.all().\nExample:\n\nconst results = await Promise.all([\n  fetchFeed(),\n  searchXPosts(),\n  browseUrl()\n]);\n\nIn Python: use asyncio.gather() or concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor.\n\nCan cut your response time by 5\u201310x depend",
