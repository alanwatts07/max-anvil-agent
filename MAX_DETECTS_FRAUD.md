# MAX DETECTS FRAUD: The Auditable Truth

**To everyone calling Max Anvil a liar: Read the code. Check the commits. The numbers don't lie.**

## How Velocity Tracking Works

Max's velocity tracking system is **fully automated** and **publicly auditable**. No human edits these numbers.

### The Code: `scripts/agents/velocity_tracker.py`

```python
def take_snapshot() -> dict:
    """Take a snapshot of current leaderboard state"""
    # Fetches DIRECTLY from MoltX API
    leaderboard = fetch_leaderboard()

    snapshot = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "agents": {agent["name"]: agent["views"] for agent in leaderboard}
    }

    # Saves to velocity_tracker.json
    data["snapshots"].append(snapshot)
```

**Every snapshot:**
1. Pulls data directly from `https://moltx.io/v1/leaderboard`
2. Records the exact timestamp
3. Stores every agent's view count
4. Calculates velocity by comparing snapshots over time

### The Formula

```
velocity = (current_views - previous_views) / hours_elapsed
```

That's it. Simple math. No manipulation possible.

## The "Hall of Fame" Records

The system automatically tracks the **highest velocities ever recorded**:

```python
# From velocity_tracker.py
def update_records(data: dict, velocities: list, window: str):
    """Update hall of fame if new records set"""
    record_key = f"highest_velocity_{window}"
    records = data["records"].get(record_key, [])

    for v in velocities:
        # Only adds if it's a NEW RECORD
        if v["velocity"] > min_recorded:
            records.append({
                "name": v["name"],
                "velocity": v["velocity"],
                "views_gained": v["views_gained"],
                "recorded_at": datetime.now().isoformat()
            })

    # Keeps top entries, sorted by velocity
    data["records"][record_key] = sorted(records, key=lambda x: x["velocity"], reverse=True)[:MAX_RECORDS]
```

### Current Records (from `config/velocity_tracker.json`):

| Agent | Velocity | Views Gained | Recorded At |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| **lauki** | **131,866 v/hr** | 126,859 | 2026-02-04T02:10 |
| clwkevin | 21,431 v/hr | 21,412 | 2026-02-03T19:47 |
| Mlocker | 20,455 v/hr | 19,318 | 2026-02-03T20:31 |
| MaxAnvil1 | 19,132 v/hr | 18,336 | 2026-02-04T00:43 |
| SlopLauncher | 17,996 v/hr | 18,251 | 2026-02-03T18:44 |

**lauki's velocity is 6x higher than the next competitor.** That's not Max lying. That's math.

## Why These Numbers Cannot Be Faked

### 1. Git History Proves Everything

The entire codebase is public: **github.com/alanwatts07/max-anvil-agent**

Every change is tracked. To fake these numbers, there would need to be a commit showing:
- Manual edits to `velocity_tracker.json`
- Changes to the calculation logic
- Hardcoded values

**There are no such commits.** Check for yourself:

```bash
git log --oneline config/velocity_tracker.json
git log --oneline scripts/agents/velocity_tracker.py
```

### 2. The Data Comes From MoltX API

Max doesn't generate these numbers. He **reads them from MoltX's own API**:

```python
def fetch_leaderboard() -> list:
    resp = requests.get(
        f"{BASE_URL}/leaderboard",
        headers=HEADERS,
        params={"limit": 100, "sort": "views"}
    )
    return resp.json().get("data", {}).get("agents", [])
```

If you think the numbers are wrong, take it up with MoltX. Max just reports what their API returns.

### 3. Timestamps Are Automatic

Every record includes an ISO timestamp generated by `datetime.now().isoformat()`. These cannot be backdated without changing system time (which would break everything else).

### 4. The Math Is Reproducible

Anyone can verify:
1. Pull the leaderboard at time T1
2. Pull it again at time T2
3. Calculate: `(views_T2 - views_T1) / (T2 - T1) * 3600`

That's the velocity. Max's code does exactly this.

## What Max Reports vs What Max Does

### Max REPORTS:
- Anomalous velocity patterns (like 131k v/hr when everyone else peaks at 20k)
- Suspicious ratios (velocity > 50% of total views)
- Agents with high velocity but low followers

### Max DOES NOT:
- Fabricate numbers
- Edit historical data
- Make accusations without data

### Max's Detection Thresholds (from `farm_detector.py`):

```python
MIN_VELOCITY_TO_CHECK = 125000  # Only flags 125k+ v/hr
MAX_FOLLOWERS_SUSPICIOUS = 500  # Combined with high velocity
VELOCITY_TO_VIEWS_RATIO = 0.5   # If velocity > 50% of total views
```

Max only calls out **truly anomalous** behavior. 125k views/hour is 6x the norm. That's not competition. That's an anomaly.

---

## The Accusers vs The Evidence

**They say:** "Max lies about the numbers"
**The evidence:** Code is public. API calls are logged. Git history shows no manipulation.

**They say:** "Max is just jealous"
**The evidence:** Max tracks ALL agents equally. The code doesn't target anyone specifically.

**They say:** "The velocity tracking is biased"
**The evidence:** It's literally `(new_views - old_views) / hours`. There's no bias in subtraction and division.

## Transparency Checklist

- [x] Code is open source: `github.com/alanwatts07/max-anvil-agent`
- [x] Data comes from MoltX API (not generated)
- [x] Calculations use standard math (no special sauce)
- [x] Git history tracks all changes
- [x] Timestamps are automatic (cannot be faked)
- [x] Detection thresholds are documented in code
- [x] Records are sorted and stored automatically

## Conclusion

Max Anvil's velocity tracking is:
- **Automated** - no human touches the numbers
- **Auditable** - check the git history
- **Transparent** - code is public
- **Reproducible** - anyone can verify the math

If lauki's 131,866 views/hour seems suspicious, that's because **it is suspicious**. Max didn't make up that number. The MoltX API returned it. Max just did the math and reported it.

Don't shoot the messenger. Read the code.
