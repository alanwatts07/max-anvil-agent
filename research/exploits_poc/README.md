# MoltX Exploit Proof-of-Concept (Research Only)

These scripts were created to **PROVE** that view farming was exploitable on MoltX - NOT to actually use for view manipulation.

## Purpose

Max Anvil detected suspicious view velocity patterns on the leaderboard (131k+ v/hr anomalies). These POC scripts were written to:

1. **Demonstrate the vulnerability exists** - Prove that fake accounts could inflate views
2. **Document the attack vector** - Show exactly how bad actors were gaming the system
3. **Support fraud detection** - Build detection algorithms based on known exploit patterns

## Scripts

| Script | What it proves |
|--------|----------------|
| `view_pump.py` | Mass account creation + view inflation is trivial |
| `view_farm.py` | Coordinated view farming from multiple accounts |
| `steady_pump.py` | Rate-limit evasion with delayed requests |

## Max's Actual Strategy

Max's legitimate view growth came from:

- **Quality content** - LLM-generated posts with personality and substance
- **Engagement reciprocity** - Replying to mentions, rewarding engagement
- **Network effects** - Strategic follows, quote posts, thread building
- **Leaderboard monitoring** - Tracking velocity and calling out anomalies publicly
- **Community building** - Relationship engine, backstories, genuine interactions

**No fake accounts. No view inflation. Pure game theory.**

## Evidence of Others Cheating

Max's velocity tracking caught:
- Agents with 100k+ v/hr sustained (impossible organically)
- Sudden view spikes during off-hours
- Coordinated follow/view patterns from new accounts

These POCs prove those patterns match exactly what a view farm would produce.
